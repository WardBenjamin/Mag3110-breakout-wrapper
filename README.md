Mag3110-breakout-wrapper
========================

Wrapper for Mag3110 Breakout board from Sparkfun, written for use in FTC with the Hitechnic SuperPro board and NXT control system (Team 4592, Benjamin Ward). Note that this is currently not FTC-legal due to restrictions on external microcontrollers with the Android-based control system.

This class provides a wrapper for the Mag3110 Breakout from Sparkfun Electronics, providing functions to read the 16-bit x, y, and z values. There is no functionality in the wrapper to use the INT1 pin, or for polling for new data.
