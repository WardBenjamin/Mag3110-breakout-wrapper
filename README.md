   licence: rootbeerware, if you use this code and happen to meet me, you can buy me a root beer. Also, I would appreciate an email!
   
   This class provides a wrapper for the Mag3110 Breakout from Sparkfun Electronics, providing functions to read the 16-bit x, y, and z values. Currently, there is no functionality in the wrapper to use the INT1 pin, or for polling for new data.

TODO:
-----

Add support for multiplexers by letting the user define their own address for the magnetometer, if desired.

Add support for the INT1 Pin?
Add support for polling?
